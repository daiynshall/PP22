# Practice 2 — Python Control Flow Basics

This folder contains small, commented Python examples for:
- Booleans
- if / else / elif (including short-hand)
- while loops (with break/continue)
- for loops (with break/continue)

## Folder structure

```
Practice2/
├── boolean/
├── if_else/
└── loops/
```

## How to run

From the repository root (where `Practice2/` exists):

```bash
python Practice2/boolean/boolean_intro.py
python Practice2/if_else/if_elif_else.py
python Practice2/loops/for_continue.py
```

## Suggested commits (3+ meaningful commits)

1) Add booleans
```bash
git add Practice2/boolean Practice2/README.md
git commit -m "Add Practice2 boolean examples"
```

2) Add if/else
```bash
git add Practice2/if_else
git commit -m "Add Practice2 if-else examples"
```

3) Add loops
```bash
git add Practice2/loops
git commit -m "Add Practice2 loop examples"
```

Finally push:
```bash
git push origin main
```

> Note: Examples are written in my own words (W3Schools-inspired), and you can edit/extend them with more "Try It Yourself" experiments.

## Notes
- Added extra notes after completing W3Schools Try It examples.
